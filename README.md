# mongoColab

This repository is an easy way of team collaboration in a Mongodb Analysis.  Theres some groupings made with the operator AGGREGATE and other requests done with the operator FIND.

We also made a join of two collections with the LOOKUP operator.

Heres is where you can find both collections:

companies:

Stock market historic:

All comments about what the query does are in french.
